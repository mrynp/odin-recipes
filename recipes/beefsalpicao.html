    <p>Beef Salpicao is a filipino dish composed of beef, garlic, butter and a seasoning sauce. There are a lot of beef
        salpicao recipes online but this one is the first one I tried and it is just so good that I didn't bother trying
        other recipes. The cut of beef used can be interchanged with tenderloin, sirloin or prime ribeye steaks. This
        dish is best served with white rice, but some enjoy it with garlic rice as well.</p>

        <li>Start seasoning with the sauce mix, tablespoon by tablespoon, depending on how salty and saucy you want the
            dish.</li>
        <li>Add the spring onions and stir fry for an additional 4 mins until the meat is cooked to your liking</li>
